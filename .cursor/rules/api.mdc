- Always refer the decorators.py file inside the core folder which should be included for every API
- Make sure to use the custom exceptions mentioned in the exceptions.py file inside the core folder
- If a new exception arises for a standard HTTP error code which does not exists, add in the exceptions.py file, unless mentioned explicitly
